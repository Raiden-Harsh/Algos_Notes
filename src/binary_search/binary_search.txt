This is the theory behind the binary search...
NOTE: BINARY SEARCH ONLY WORKS ON SORTED ARRAYS
let us assume we have a sorted array as:
   arr = p[2,4,5,7,8,9,14,18,19,55];
   and our target element is say "14"
To find the target element in this sorted array we do the following steps :
Step_1) Find the middle element
Step_2) Check weather the target is
            less than the middle element // case 1
            equal to the middle element
            greater than the middle element
