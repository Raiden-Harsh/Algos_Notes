Before Quick Sort:
Q) What is a Pivot?
It is basically any random element form the array!
after first pass, the condition is :
    > all the elements smaller than the pivot should be on the left side of pivot.
    > all the elements larger than the pivot should be on the right side of the pivot.

Q) How to Pick a pivot?
A Pivot can be a-
    > Random element
    > Corner element
    > Middle element

Recurrence relation of Quick Sort:
say, array have "N" total elements,
     after pivot "K" elements goes to one side,
     pivot itself is 1 element,
     so element remaining on right is (N-K-1)

     T(N) = T(K) + T(N-K-1) + O(N)
     here,
        T(N) = time taken to sort complete array
        T(K) = time taken to sort left side of array
        T(N-K-1) = time taken to sort right side of array
        O(N) = time taken to sort one element
------------------------
Worst Case: A pivot is the smallest/largest number in the array.
   this means, one side of array is zero!
   so the time complexity will be:
   T(N) = T(0) + T(N-0-1) + O(N)
   T(N) = T(N-1) + O(N)
   this will give a time complexity of : O(NÂ²)
   THIS IS BAD!!!
   as the recurrence steps are only reduced by (N-1)
Best Case: A pivot is the exact middle element.
    this means, K = N/2
    T(N) = T(N/2) + T(N- N/2 -1) + O(N)
    T(N) = 2T(N/2) + O(N)
    this will give a time complexity of : O(N*log(N))

---------------------
Important Observations:
Quick-Sort is:
    > Not-Stable: order of same elements may differ!
    > In-Place: no new arrays are created, original array is being modified.
    > MERGE-SORT IS BETTER FOR LINKED LIST AS THEY HAVE A RANDOM MEMORY ALLOCATION.
